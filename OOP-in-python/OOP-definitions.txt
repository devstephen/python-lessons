Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm for code organisation and design
that views software program as a collection of objects that interact with each other

OOP simply means using Python to create representation of real world things in code

An object is a container of data and behaviour


Attributes define an object's state or internal data.
Attributes can be viewed as variables belonging to an object


A method can be viewed as a function belonging to an object
A method is a command or an instruction or a message to send to an object
A method can interact with and modify the object's attributes, thus altering the state
 
Attributes are details while methods are actions


A class is a blueprint for defining a new object type in Python
A class definition describes the attributes and methods that each object made from the class will have.

An instance is an object created from a class. The act of creating an instance is called instantiation.

Objects created from the same class are independent of each other
