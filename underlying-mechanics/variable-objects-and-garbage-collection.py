# A variable is a name, identifier or reference for an object
# A variable does not have a data type in Python. It's just a pointer

# Garbage collection in Python is a mechanism that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. 
# This means Python takes care of freeing up memory that's no longer being used by your program, without you having to do it manually.
